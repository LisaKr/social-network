//we are passing it a react component and an html element which is on the page

//this is jsx (js xml) syntax which react team invented. html tags start with lower case and components
//start with capital letter
//a jsx element is an expression
//we need the tags aeound the function but not around the status element. theoretically invoking the funciton withou
//tags would work too
//components made with a function are called functional components
//they must return a single element
//you would put one big div like main in vue

//prop is atuomatically there

//to pass it down to another function
//Greetee greetee={props.greetee}

//if i want a dynamic class name or something its single curly braces
//if i want to style it right there i need to do in with an object
//var style = {color: tomato, fonstSize: 12px};
//<div style={style}>

//{{props.children}} will just apply whatever children you put in later on

//functional compotents dont have state. class does. if you wanna use state you should use class
//when the state changes you want react to REACT to this change

//class component sets props of the component to whatever was passed to the component
